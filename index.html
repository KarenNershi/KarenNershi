                        I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University's Stanford Internet Observatory and the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). My research focuses on international political economy questions related to the use of new technology (especially cryptocurrency) as well as how new technology can be used to study traditional international political economy questions.

                        I earned a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation examines cross-national variation in anti-money laundering enforcement looking specifically at cryptocurrency. My research has been supported by the University of Pennsylvania GAPSA Provost Fellowship for Innovation and the Christopher H. Browne Center for International Politics.

                        <br>
                         The rise of cryptocurrency (decentralized digital currency) presents challenges for state regulators given its pseudonymous nature and connection to illegal activity, allowing both individuals and businesses to engage in regulatory arbitrage. I assess the degree to which states have managed to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a detailed study of international efforts to impose common regulatory standards for a new technology. I provide a dataset of cryptocurrency transactions collected from exchanges located in countries around the world during a two-month period in 2020 and employ bunching estimation to compare levels of unusual activity below a threshold at which exchanges are required by law to screen their customers for money laundering risk. I find that exchanges in some, but not all, countries show unusual activity below the threshold; these findings suggest that while countries have made progress toward regulating cryptocurrency exchanges, gaps in enforcement across countries continue to allow for regulatory arbitrage.

                        <br>
                        Scholars argue that money laundering causes significant economic harm and identify economic costs as a potential mechanism driving countries to enforce anti-money laundering laws, but there is little documented evidence to support these claims. Another potential mechanism behind anti-money laundering enforcement is the risk of sanctioning by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization dedicated to combating money laundering. In this project, I test the effect of two types of money laundering events – FATF blacklisting and news coverage of major money laundering cases – on three potential sources of economic harm (gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, financial instability, and foreign investment) using the robust synthetic control method. I show that FATF blacklisting contributed to a significant decrease in GDP per capita, while major money laundering cases did not significantly affect economic outcomes. This research provides the﻿ first quantitative estimates of the economic costs of two types of money laundering events, which holds important implications for understanding the mechanisms driving international cooperation in anti-money laundering enforcement.

                        <br>
                        Over the past two decades, China has invested heavily in Africa alongside a growing demand for key minerals, leading some scholars to argue that investment has increased China’s political influence in receiving countries. Conversely, some argue that Chinese investment has created backlash as it extracts finite natural resources without creating local economic benefits. I test whether Chinese investment has led to political influence by measuring changes in attitudes toward China and support for democracy (the main alternative to the Chinese political model) in localities receiving Chinese investment. Using data from Afrobarometer, Pew Research, and AidData, I test this question across 297 localities in 25 African countries between 1999 and 2015 and employ Bartik-like shift-share instruments to exogenously predict Chinese investment. This paper provides evidence that Chinese investment has negatively impacted support for free elections in Africa (though there is no significant effect for other democracy-related outcomes) and offers a rigorous empirical test of whether foreign investment can produce political influence.
